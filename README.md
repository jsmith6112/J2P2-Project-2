![SBA_Annual_Lending](Images/SBA_Lending.jpg?raw=true "Annual Lending")

We evaluated the distribution of SBA 7a loans during the period from Jan 2012 until March 2020 using a variety of tools. Our analysis provides an overview of how much money is distributed each year by the Small Business Administration, where the loans are used and which banks in each state are involved.  If you're looking to secure a loan from the SBA for your business. This is a great tool to help you get started.

## Objectives
Review the distribution of Small Business Administration 7a Loans in the US. We wanted to understand the following:
 
 - How much money does the SBA distribute each year?
 - Which industries recieve support and how much do they receive?
 - What are the associated demographics for SBA Loans in the US?
 - If a small Business wanted to apply for a loan, which Banks can they contact for support?
